# Standalone Experiments

This branch contains a template for standalone experiments, which means that experiments that are a library, which doesn't depend on runtime changes and doesn't need the overhead of having all the runtime, libraries and installer code, can use this minimal template.

## Create your experiment

1. Create a new branch from this branch and make sure the branch name follows the naming guidelines to get CI and Official Build support. The name should use the `feature/` prefix.

2. Identify whether you need to consume new APIs or features from `dotnet/runtime` and need to be able to consume these on a faster cadence than using a daily SDK build:
    - I don't need to depend on `dotnet/runtime`:
        1. Update the `global.json` file and specify the minimum required `dotnet` tool and SDK version that you need to build and run tests.
        2. Remove the `runtimes` section under `tools`.
        3. Set `UseCustomRuntimeVersion` property to `false` in `Directory.Build.props`
    - I do need to depend on `dotnet/runtime`:
        1. Set a DARC dependency from `dotnet/runtime` to your branch in this repository. For more information on how to do it, see [here](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/Documentation/Darc.md#darc)


        > Note that if you want to run `dotnet test` in you test projects you will need to either first run `build.cmd/sh` or install the runtime version specified by `MicrosoftNETCoreAppVersion` property in `Versions.props` in your global dotnet install. If you run `build.cmd/sh` arcade infrastructure will make sure that the repo `dotnet` SDK found in `<RepoRoot>\.dotnet` folder, has this runtime installed. Then during the build of the test projects, we generate a `.runsettings` file that points to this `dotnet` SDK.


> For both options above, you can choose whether your experiment needs arcade latest features, to do that, set the required DARC subscription from `dotnet/arcade` to this repository following these [instructions](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/Documentation/Darc.md#darc).

3. Set the right version for your library. In order to do that, set the following properties in `Versions.props`:
    - `VersionPrefix`: the version prefix for the produced nuget package.
    - `MajorVersion/MinorVersion/PatchVersion`: Properties that control file version.
    - `PreReleaseVersionLabel`: this is the label that your package will contain when producing a non stable package. i.e: `MyExperiment.1.0.0-alpha-23432.1.nupkg`.

4. Choose the right set of platforms for CI and Official Builds by tweaking `eng/pipelines/runtimelab.yml` file. 

5. Rename `Experimental.sln`, `Experimental.csproj` and `Experimental.Tests.csproj` to your experiment name. 

The package produced from your branch will be published to the the [`dotnet-experimental`](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging?_a=feed&feed=dotnet-experimental) feed.
