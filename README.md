# .NET Runtime Lab

This repo is for experimentation and exploring new ideas that may or may not make it into the main [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) repo. [Encouraging .NET Runtime Experiments](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35609) describes reasons that motivated creating this repository.

## Active Experimental Projects

Currently, this repo contains the following experimental projects:

- [DllImportGenerator](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/tree/feature/DllImportGenerator) - Roslyn Source Generator used for generating P/Invoke IL stubs.
- [JsonCodeGen](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/tree/feature/JsonCodeGen) - Code generation for JSON.
- [NativeAOT](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/tree/feature/NativeAOT) - .NET runtime optimized for ahead of time compilation.
- [Utf8String](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/tree/feature/Utf8String) - A new UTF-8 String data type in the runtime.
- [FreeBSD](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/tree/feature/FreeBSD) - Port of .NET runtime to FreeBSD
- [NativeAOT-LLVM](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/tree/feature/NativeAOT-LLVM) - LLVM generation for Native AOT compilation (including Web Assembly)
- [ManagedQuic](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/tree/feature/ManagedQuic) - Fully managed implementation of QUIC protocol
- [LLHTTP](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/tree/feature/LLHTTP2) - a  set of flexible, lower-level HTTP APIs.
- [CompatibilityPackages](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/tree/feature/CompatibilityPackages) - a set of packages which help satisfy binary dependencies of .NETFramework assemblies on .NET.

You can create your own experiment, learn more [here](CreateAnExperiment.md)!

## Completed Projects
