# .NET Runtime - Native AOT

This branch contains experimental fork of CoreCLR [.NET runtime](http://github.com/dotnet/runtime) optimized for the [Native AOT Form factor](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2020/form-factors.md#native-aot-form-factors). The ahead-of-time (AOT) toolchain can compile .NET application into a native (architecture specific) single-file executable. It can also produce standalone dynamic or static libraries that can be consumed by applications written in other programming languages.

## Samples

The packages for Linux, macOS and Windows x64 are published to a dedicated NuGet feed after each pull request. Using this AOT compiler and runtime is as simple as adding a new package reference to your .NET project and publishing it. Check out one of our samples: a "[Hello World](samples/HelloWorld)" console app or a [native library](samples/NativeLibrary). The `README.md` file in each sample's directory will guide you through the process step by step.

## Documentation

- [Using Native AOT](docs/using-nativeaot/README.md) explains how to debug, optimize and troubleshoot applications published using the native AOT toolchain. This documentation is for people who are interested in using the toolchain.
- [Developer workflow](docs/workflow/building/coreclr/nativeaot.md) explains how to build the repo, run tests and work on the Native AOT toolchain. This documentation is for people who are interested in making changes in the toolchain.

## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback
Some of the best ways to contribute are to try things out, file bugs, and join in design conversations.
