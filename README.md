# .NET Runtime - Managed QUIC implementation

## Supported QUIC Protocol Features

This implementation is highly in WIP state. The features are at the draft-27 version. The goal was
to obtain a minimal working implementation able to reliably transmit data between client and server.
This can be used to evaluate the viability of purely C# implementation for production releases. Some
transport-unrelated features are left unimplemented.

Currently implemented:

- Basic connection establishment
- Encryption
- TLS integration backed by [modified OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8797)
- Sending data, flow control, loss recovery, congestion control
- Stream/Connection termination
- Coalescing packets into a single UDP datagram

## Unsupported QUIC Protocol Features

A list of highlights of unimplemented protocol features follows:

- Connection migration
- Stateless reset
- 0-RTT data
- Server Preferred Address
- Version Negotiation
- Address Validation
- Encryption key updates

## OpenSSL integration

To function correctly, the implementation requires a custom branch of OpenSSL from Akamai
https://github.com/akamai/openssl/tree/OpenSSL_1_1_1g-quic. The implementation tries to detect that
a QUIC-supporting OpenSSL is present in the path. If not, then a mock implementation is used
instead.

The mock implementation can be used for trying the implementation locally, but interoperation with
other QUIC implementations is, of course, possible only with the OpenSSL-based TLS. If you want to
make sure your implementation runs with OpenSSL, define the `DOTNETQUIC_OPENSSL` environment
variable. This will cause the implementation to throw if proper OpenSSL version cannot be loaded.

## Tracing and qvis

To simplify debugging, this implementation can emit traces that can be analyzed. Note that emiting
traces has negative impact on the performance of the implementation.

### Console

To get traces printed to the console, define `DOTNETQUIC_TRACE` environment variable to `console`.

### qlog and qvis

The implementation can produce traces that can be consumed by https://qvis.edm.uhasselt.be
visualizer. To collect traces, define `DOTNETQUIC_TRACE` environment variable to `qlog`.
The traces will be saved in the working directory in a file named
_[timestamp]-[server|client].qvis_.

## Disabling encryption

Regardless of the TLS used, you can circumvent the encryption by defining the `DOTNETQUIC_NOENCRYPT`
environment variable to something nonempty.
