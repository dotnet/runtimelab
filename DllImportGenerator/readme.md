# DllImport Generator

See [P/Invoke source generator proposal](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/design/features/source-generator-pinvokes.md) for design and goals.

## Additional work

Below are additional work items that are not presently captured in this repository.

### Required

* Add `GeneratedDllImportAttribute` to the BCL. See [`GeneratedDllImportAttribute.cs`](./DllImportGeneratorAttribute/GeneratedDllImportAttribute.cs).
* Add support for calling [`SetLastError()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-setlasterror) from managed code with the expected semantics. During P/Invoke transitions the runtime manipulates the associated thread's error code and thus breaks `SetLastError()` semantics.

### Optional

* A tool to compare the resulting IL from the generated source to that generated by the built-in IL Marshaller system. This would help with validation of what is being generated.
